LONDON , England -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- They were entrusted with gold .

The Beatles , shown here in 1964 , left behind a wealth of material , which was carefully handled by EMI 's engineers .

When the Beatles ' longtime record label , EMI , decided to remaster the Beatles ' music , they gave the raw material to a handful of men . Among them were EMI engineers Allan Rouse , the project coordinator , and Sean Magee .

Rouse , in particular , was familiar with the tapes . He was the person who had copied them from their original analog form to digital as a safety backup in 1991 . He 's since worked on the Beatles projects `` Live at the BBC , '' `` The Beatles Anthology '' and `` Let It Be ... Naked . ''

CNN 's Jim Boulden was given the chance to sit down with Rouse and Magee . The following is an edited and condensed version of the interview . For the complete interview -- including some technical details -- click here -LRB- . pdf file -- requires Adobe Acrobat -RRB-

CNN : Why was this project taken and why so long ?

Rouse : It was started 4 1/2 years ago and it has taken over that period of time about a year to do the whole thing . On average about two weeks per album . Explore a timeline of the Beatles over the decades

CNN : What does this allow you to do that you could n't have done to these songs before ?

Rouse : When they were originally transferred to CD in 1986 , digital technology was in its infancy and the gap of 22 years has allowed for a great increase in that technology . So the transfers are far superior now and that was before we actually did any work to them .

In addition to that , we had decided that we wanted to remove or improve technical faults within the recordings that could have been a bad edit , a dropout , vocal sibilance , vocal pops . Things that were directly related to the technical recording rather than the human recordings , so in other words we have n't taken out breaths or little coughs or squeaky chairs or Ringo 's occasional squeaky bassdrum pedal .

CNN : Tell us about the process ? And that is where you came in -LSB- Sean -RSB- .

Magee : The first part of the process is choosing what equipment you are going to use to do the image and the transfers . ... And then after choosing ... everything was transferred track by track into protocols , making sure the tape heads were nice and clean and the tape speed was constantly monitored , so the best possible transfer could happen .

Then Guy Massey , who did all the transfers , went in with the restoration engineer -- a guy named Simon Gibson -- they then looked at all the various ticks , pops , sibilance and sorted all that out . ... That now becomes your master tape and that 's when we started , really .

CNN : Each -LSB- song -RSB- had its own challenges ?

Magee : Absolutely .

CNN : What were the differences ? Would it take a week on a song , six months on a song ?

Magee : More likely four or five hours on a song . On average we took about two weeks per album . But sometimes it might be three or four hours on a song , it might be 10 minutes on a song .

CNN : How much involvement was there from the Beatles themselves ?

Rouse : They were n't involved in the process . Obviously they have to sign off on it . So when we finished it , we provided them with a copy of every album . But the process was over such a long period of time and it would be very complicated to have involved them anyway . I 'd like to think they have some trust in us because we 've done numerous other jobs for Apple .

CNN : And you have n't heard back and that is good news ?

Rouse : Basically , if the phone does n't ring , that is good news , yes .

CNN : There always will be people who say ... you are messing with something in the original --

Rouse : Playing with the crown jewels .

CNN : There probably will be a critic out there that will complain .

Rouse : Yes .

CNN : But you are clearly pleased with your outcome ?

Rouse : Yes , I think , actually before we even started work on them , by doing an -LSB- equalization -RSB- ... they actually sounded better and I think quite frankly , probably the closest they have sounded to the original masters , than they have done ever before .

CNN : Anything surprise you by going through this whole process ?

Rouse : Probably the only surprise is that when I started buying the vinyl in the '60s , I bought stereo , so I had never heard mono , and to be honest with you it was actually quite a fascinating experience to sit and listen to , particularly `` Sgt. Pepper '' in mono .

I mean , up until `` Sgt. Pepper '' and beyond , up to the White Album in fact , the monos were considered to be the real masters in the sense that in the '60s Britain was n't up to speed , we had n't quite got to stereo . The only people who really had stereo in those days were people who could afford it and invariably that meant they were listening to classical music or middle-of-the-road music . ...

To suddenly hear the monos , I don ¹ t think , in fact , I had listened to the mono `` Sgt. Pepper '' in all the years I have been doing Beatles work . Until this particular time .

CNN : The press release says you took out bad edits . I did n't know there would have been bad edits in the original Beatles .

Rouse : There was n't many to be honest , I mean it was just an issue that we could deal with now . There were a few songs where they had created it over two takes and they wanted to use a part of one take and a part of another , and sometimes the edit was n't as good as it could be . In some cases we could n't do anything about it , But if we could we would try and smooth it over so it was n't so obvious .

CNN : Did you achieve -LSB- what you were going for -RSB- ?

Rouse : I think that 's up to other people to judge , is n't it . ... It was a team effort . And I think that was the most important thing , one person wasn ¹ t involved in just doing the one thing . In fact it would have been ...

CNN : Awful ?

Rouse : ... it would have been unfair .

CNN : Was there a time pressure as well ?

Rouse : No there was no time pressure . There was a possibility of them coming out sooner , but we were way up anyway by that point . That got extended .

I think that when EMI put the press release out , we all did a double take and thought , `` Oh my God , they 're coming out now . We can ¹ t do anything about it now . Should we go back and start again ? '' There was some fear and trepidation at that point . Realizing that after four years not quite knowing when they were gon na come out , to suddenly be told `` That 's it , no more time lads . You 're finished .

CNN : And now they are ready for digital downloads if we get to that point .

Rouse : They are . If they do .
