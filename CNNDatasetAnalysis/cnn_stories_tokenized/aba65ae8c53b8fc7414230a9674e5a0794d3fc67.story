-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- An alleged child predator who taught at schools across the world for more than four decades may have more victims , and the FBI is trying to track them down , the agency 's Houston bureau said Tuesday .

William James Vahey killed himself in Luverne , Minnesota , last month , two days after a federal judge in Houston said authorities could search one of Vahey 's thumb drives that allegedly contained images depicting sexual assault on children , CNN affiliate KPRC reported .

There were images of at least 90 victims , dating back to 2008 , and the FBI is encouraging additional alleged victims to come forward . The images on the thumb drive allegedly belonging to Vahey showed boys , estimated to be between 12 and 14 years old , asleep or unconscious , the agency said .

The images had captions and dates referencing places that Vahey had previously traveled with students , the FBI said .

`` This is one of the most prolific alleged predators we 've ever seen , '' Houston FBI Special Agent Shauna Dunlap told the station .

Vahey began teaching in private schools in 1972 , the FBI says . He last taught at the American Nicaraguan School in Pista Suburbana , Managua , Nicaragua from August 2013 until March 11 , two days before he committed suicide , KPRC reported .

The case came to law enforcement attention after Vahey fired his maid for allegedly stealing personal items from his home last year , KPRC said . In March , the ex-maid brought a stolen thumb drive to the American Nicaraguan School , saying she came forward because the drive contained sexual images , the station reported .

The FBI said that when Vahey was confronted with the images , he `` reportedly admitted molesting boys throughout his entire life and said he gave the minors sleeping pills prior to the molestation . ''

He had residences in London and Hilton Head Island , South Carolina , and traveled extensively , the FBI said . He worked at schools in nine countries , teaching a variety of subjects and coaching boys ' basketball . He regularly accompanied students on overnight field trips , the FBI said .

The schools where he taught are , according to the FBI :
