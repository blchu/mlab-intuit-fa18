-LRB- Lonely Planet -RRB- -- What 's the first thing you think of when you think of Hawaii ? The foaming-white sea lapping at a golden-sand beach surrounded by palm trees swaying in the breeze ? Well , sure -- Hawaii 's one of the world 's ultimate beach destinations , an island paradise made for basking in the sun sipping daiquiris or hitting the waves to surf some righteous tubes .

But what to do if you 're one of those people who just ca n't stand beaches ? -LRB- Scorching sunburn , salt in your hair and sand everywhere ! -RRB- If you 're a beach hater , do n't dismiss Hawaii just yet : there 's plenty to do on the Hawaiian islands where you 'll never have to step foot on sand . Here are some of our suggestions .

HAWAI'I -LRB- the Big Island -RRB-

Mauna Kea

This dormant volcano 's peak is 4205 m -LRB- 13,796 ft -RRB- above sea level -- the highest mountain in the state of Hawaii . -LRB- If you measure from its base underneath the Pacific , though , it 's 10,000 m -LRB- 33,000 ft -RRB- tall -- making it the tallest mountain on Earth . -RRB-

With such a clear vantage point , it 's no wonder that its snowy summit is dotted with the greatest collection of astronomical telescopes in the world . The Onizuka Center here offers astronomy displays and nightly stargazing programs to the public .

Experienced mountaineers can even hike 12 miles to the summit through an otherworldly landscape of volcanic cinder cones and ancient archaeological sites .

Hawai'i Volcanoes National Park

If you 'd prefer to see some live volcano action , head southeast to this unique national park , where Kilauea , the world 's most active volcano , has been erupting continuously since 1983 .

Outside the park boundaries , depending on conditions the day you visit , you may even be able to see fresh molten lava flowing into the sea -LRB- which is slowly but surely making the Big Island even bigger , year after year -RRB- .

But even if the volcano goddess Pele is n't cooperating , there are still plenty of intriguing sights within the park 's confines : hollowed-out lava tubes , steaming craters , tropical rainforest and old lava trails .

Rangers offer guided walks and other activities at the visitor center . For information on volcanic activity , the National Park Service has helpful updates -LRB- plus lava cam -RRB- .

MAUI

Upcountry Maui and Haleakala National Park

The volcanic soil and sloped pastures of Mt Haleakala have sustained much of Maui 's farming and livestock for the past two centuries , and the paniolo -LRB- cowboy -RRB- vibe is still strong in towns like rustic Makawao .

A drive through the plush pastures of the Kula region will take you past cattle ranches , vineyards with cellar-door sales , goat dairies and a huge lavender farm -LRB- with a cafe and gift shop offering lavender versions of just about any foodstuff or cosmetic product you can imagine -- and even those you ca n't -RRB- .

If you keep driving you can follow a tortuously winding road up the flank of Mt Haleakala itself , up 3055 m -LRB- 10,023 ft -RRB- to the summit , where you can explore the surreal , lunar-like landscape -- home to unique flora such as the ten-year-blooming Haleakala silversword , which grows nowhere else on Earth -- and stare down at clouds filling enormous volcanic craters below you .

If you can get up early -LRB- or stay up late -RRB- enough , book a tour to catch the sublime sight of sunrise from the peak ; you can also have a van take you and a bicycle up to the top so you can ride -- er , roll all the way down .

Lahaina

This colorful town was once the whaling capital of the Pacific , where ships would dock for supplies , sailors and shore leave . Today the dance halls , saloons and brothels that kept the whalers busy have been replaced by the best restaurants on Maui , art galleries that host free `` art nights '' every Friday , bars with live music from Irish trad to jazz and , of course , souvenir shops -LRB- c'mon , it is Hawaii -RRB- . Meanwhile , Lahaina 's seafaring past is kept alive by the numerous whale-watching cruises that depart from its harbor .

O'AHU

Diamond Head

This extinct volcanic tuff cone stands guard over Waikiki , and is O'ahu 's signature backdrop . You can hike to the top in about an hour or less -- a paved trail leads 1.3 km -LRB- 0.8 miles -RRB- all the way to the summit , which at 232 m -LRB- 760 ft -RRB- affords some pretty awesome views of Waikiki . -LRB- OK , you 'll still have to see a beach , but you wo n't have to step on it . Happy ? -RRB-

USS Arizona Memorial

The tragic events of December 7,1941 are memorialized at Pearl Harbor , just a short drive from downtown Honolulu . The USS Arizona lies where it sank , the resting place of over a thousand of the U.S. sailors who died in the Japanese attack .

In 1962 the memorial was opened , with a structure built over the ship that allows you to view its remains poking out of the shallow water below ; a marble wall inside is engraved with the names of the honored dead . A visit to Pearl Harbor will leave you with a palpable sense of the history that was made there .

KAUA'I

Waimea Canyon

This gigantic chasm at the heart of Kaua'i is one of the island 's greatest natural wonders , and its red-and-black-striated lava-rock walls contrasted with the lush green forests that blanket its top is a true sight to behold .

Its name comes from the Waimea River , which runs through the bottom ; the canyon was formed by a combination of erosion and the partial collapse of one of the island 's shield volcanoes .

Waimea Canyon State Park has lookout points over Kaua'i 's stunning Na Pali cliffs , as well as numerous hiking trails through and around the canyon , a wilderness lover 's delight .

Helicopter ride over Kaua'i

Way more thrilling than a day at the beach is a helicopter ride over the interior of Kaua'i , most of which is too densely forested and mountainous for wheeled vehicles .

Numerous helicopter companies -LRB- most based in Lihu'e -RRB- offer up-in-the-air jaunts over waterfall-striped Mt Wai'ale ` ale , the island 's central shield volcano and one of the wettest spots on Earth , and the sheer-hewn sea cliffs of the Na Pali coast , accessible otherwise only by ocean kayak .

MOLOKAI

Kalaupapa National Historical Park

Hansen 's disease -LRB- leprosy -RRB- was introduced to Hawaii by foreigners in 1835 , and soon spread through the islands . King Kamehameha V , in an attempt to stop the epidemic , created a law banishing all those afflicted to this remote peninsula jutting out from beneath the towering sea cliffs -LRB- the world 's highest -RRB- of Molokai 's north coast , which became the final home for the unhappy exiles .

Around 40 years later , a compassionate Belgian missionary named Father Damien came to visit , and remained with the colony for 16 years , when he died after contracting the disease himself -LRB- Father Damien was officially canonized by the Catholic Church in 2009 -RRB- .

The enforced isolation law was finally revoked in 1969 ; today , only a handful of patients , all senior citizens , remain . You can visit the peninsula to see the village and Father Damien 's church and gravesite only by pre-arranged tour -- either flying down to the peninsula -LRB- which takes about eight minutes -RRB- or riding a mule down a steep , 2-mile -LRB- 3.2 km -RRB- route zigzagging across the cliffs .
