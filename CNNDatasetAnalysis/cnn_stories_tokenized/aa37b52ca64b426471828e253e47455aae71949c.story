`` So he had to come in and get your thing together , then he knocked down our most hated , the most wanted , the one who had our terror on orange or red or whatever color it was on -- he went and found him , the one Bush could n't seem to find , the one who seemed to fly away in the dead of night and all that , '' he continued , referring to Osama bin Laden .

Obama `` went and found him and knocked him down , so do n't forget about that . Now everybody is peaceful and able to move and go and have a good time -- it 's because he made that happen . So please do n't forget that . You understand me ? So give him -LSB- another -RSB- four years to get his thing together and finish this deal out . You heard what Clinton said . You loved Clinton , did n't you ? ''
