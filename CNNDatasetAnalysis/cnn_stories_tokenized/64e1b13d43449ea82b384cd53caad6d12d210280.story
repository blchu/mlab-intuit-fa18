New York -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Two Andy Warhol masterpieces are expected to sell for more than $ 100 million combined when they go up for auction next month in New York .

Warhol 's `` Coca-Cola -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' will be auctioned at Christie 's on November 12 , followed by his `` Silver Car Crash -LRB- Double Disaster -RRB- '' on November 13 at Sotheby 's .

`` Coca-Cola -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' , a 1962 painting by the late artist , depicts a human-size Coca-Cola bottle , and is one of the artist 's most iconic images . The auction house estimates the painting , which has resided in the same private collection for almost two decades , will go for between $ 40 million and $ 60 million .

`` At a time when international top collectors are looking for blue-chip masterpieces , nothing is more iconic ... , '' Brett Gorvy , a chairman at Christie 's , said in a press release .

`` Silver Car Crash -LRB- Double Disaster -RRB- '' , part of Warhol 's vaunted `` Death and Disaster '' series , has been in a private collection since 1988 and has rarely been viewed in public . Sotheby 's puts its auction value as possibly more than $ 60 million .

Last year , Warhol , one of the pioneers of pop art , was one of the world 's top-selling artists , posthumously generating eight figures in sales .

`` Silver Car Crash '' will be on display in London on October 12 before it heads to auction . `` Coca-Cola -LRB- 3 -RRB- '' will be on display in London October 12-18 and in New York from November 8-12 .
