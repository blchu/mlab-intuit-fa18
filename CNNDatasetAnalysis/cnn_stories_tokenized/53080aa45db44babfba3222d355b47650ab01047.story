Puerto Vallarta , Mexico -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- A lifelong nature lover , Oscar Aranda studied biology in college and knew he wanted to work somehow with animals at sea .

But he did n't find his calling until years later , when he was summoned to a beach and saw a gruesome scene that would change his life .

`` I found a turtle chopped in pieces in a bucket , and its heart was still pounding , '' Aranda said . '' -LSB- The police -RSB- needed my help to decide what to do .

`` When you see how the people kill -LSB- sea turtles -RSB- and how they are just using them for their meat and eggs -- it 's sad . ''

There was nothing Aranda could do to save the turtle that summer night 10 years ago . But ever since then , he has patrolled Puerto Vallarta 's beaches as an unofficial keeper of the sea turtle maternity ward .

Aranda 's conservation group , La Sociedad Ecol√≥gica del Occidente , is dedicated to protecting turtles that nest along Mexico 's northwest Pacific beaches . From June through December -- prime nesting season -- Aranda and his unpaid volunteers watch over the shorelines where the turtles lay their eggs .

`` The turtles are not safe , '' Aranda said . '' -LSB- A pregnant turtle -RSB- comes out in the dark , and a poacher can be hiding .

`` We are not the police , but we just want to take care of -LSB- the turtle -RSB- and be there when she comes out to lay eggs . ''

There are seven sea turtle species worldwide , and six of them return to Mexico 's shores each year to lay eggs . According to the World Wildlife Fund , all six species are `` currently in danger of extinction . '' For Aranda , this reality is daunting .

`` The sea turtles have been here since the dinosaurs , '' he said . `` Turtles are basically the link between the land and the ocean , and that movement is very important for many animals . Some species keep the reefs healthy , and there are many animals that depend on -LSB- sea -RSB- turtles to survive . They continue the life cycle . ''

Aranda 's group , which is also known as Vallarta Rescue , is nonprofit and relies entirely on private donations . To earn a living , Aranda works during the day as an ecotourism boat driver . At sunset , he heads out to what he calls the perfect job in the perfect place .

`` We go out to the beach and we wait for the turtles to come , '' he said . `` Sometimes we may see one , sometimes there are 13 . It all depends . We might miss a turtle , and then we dig for the nest she left behind . We have to be there all night . ''

Twenty years ago , the Mexican government outlawed commercial fishing of sea turtles . It started fining people up to $ 16,000 for killing turtles or trafficking turtle eggs , turtle meat or products manufactured with turtle hides . But Mexico still has one of the highest rates of turtle poaching in the world .

`` Very few poachers are caught or arrested each year , '' says marine biologist Wallace J. Nichols , who has been tracking sea turtles ' behavioral patterns throughout Latin America , Asia and the United States . `` Poaching remains a big problem in Mexico partly because the people who buy sea turtles are often powerful , and partly because it 's not a high priority '' for law enforcement .

Aranda believes the poaching business is sustained by cultural curiosity and tradition , not financial profit . A single turtle egg sells for about 50 cents .

`` I think it 's how the people feel eating something forbidden , '' he said . `` They want to try what is illegal , but -LSB- they also -RSB- believe the eggs are aphrodisiacs and they want to feel more strong . They have seen their parents and their grandparents eating them , and it 's a way of thinking that is very hard to change . ''

Changing the locals ' perspective is part of what drives Aranda to stay awake during his night patrols in Puerto Vallarta . A good night , he says , is any night when a single turtle is spotted and protected from poachers .

`` We clear the path for her to dig the hole , -LSB- we -RSB- wipe her clean of dirt and sand , and after that the babies are left alone and she returns to the ocean . ''

The team digs for the eggs , collects them and re-plants them in a protected hatchery on the CasaMagna Marriott Resort . The hotel has donated Aranda hatchery space in exchange for offering their guests turtle conservation lessons and participation in a sunset turtle release ceremony .

`` As soon as the eggs hatch , we want the people to see them and learn , '' Aranda said . `` To give them an opportunity to be part of releasing a baby turtle -LSB- is -RSB- something that they will never forget . ''

Since 2004 , when he started his conservation group , Aranda has facilitated the rescue and release of more than half a million baby turtles . The turtles ' determination to keep nesting despite natural and manmade threats inspires him to continue -- all night , every night .

`` They are endangered because of us , '' Aranda said . `` Against all odds , they continue coming . If I 'm healthy , I 'll be here . I ca n't see myself doing anything else . ''
