Nariyal Purnima -LRB- August -RRB- Roughly translated as `` Coconut Day , '' Nariyal Purnima is a festival celebrated by Mumbai 's fisher folk to mark the end of the rainy season .

Oil-filled lamps are lit in the Koli villages along the Mumbai coast and coconuts and garlands of flowers are thrown into the sea as an offering to the Sea God Varuna . Finally , brightly-painted boats take to the water carrying flickering oil lamps , marking the fishermen 's return to the sea after the monsoon .

Janmashtami -LRB- August/September -RRB- Lord Krishna 's birthday is celebrated throughout India , but in Mumbai the festivities are especially eye-catching . Legend has it that as a young boy Lord Krishna had a fondness for curd and butter -- so much so that he would sometimes break `` handis '' -LRB- clay pots -RRB- to get at the dairy treats inside .

In reference to this , during `` Janamashtami '' teams of men -LRB- known as `` Govindas '' -RRB- form human pyramids to try and break the `` handis '' suspended some 30 feet above the ground . `` Handis '' filled with cash and prizes are set up all over the city and teams of `` Govindas '' compete to break as many as possible in the course of the day .
