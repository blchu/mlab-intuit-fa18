-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Does the Internet need more rules ? Does it need any rules at all ?

Based on the comments to our story `` Meet the Rules of the Internet , '' the judgment is decidedly mixed .

The story explained the origin of the Internet 's `` rules , '' originally a set of guidelines/inside jokes spawned by a variety of sources , including the Internet collective Anonymous , the site Encyclopedia Dramatica and 4chan 's Christopher Poole .

As with many Internet memes , however , the concept quickly spread to the mainstream to the point where it 's now fairly routine to run across references to `` Rule 34 '' in blog posts and comment strings .

Some CNN commenters , however , were n't going to have any rules under any circumstances .

`` The only rule of the Internet is that there are absolutely no rules , '' said Sal , among others .

Other commenters mentioned one of the best-known Internet observations , Godwin 's Law : `` As an online discussion grows longer , the probability of a comparison involving Nazis or Hitler approaches 1 . '' Some wondered why it was n't included .

We agree : Godwin 's Law should definitely be a part of any set of Internet rules . -LRB- Personally , I blame my editor for its exclusion : Frankly , the guy is a ... -RRB-
