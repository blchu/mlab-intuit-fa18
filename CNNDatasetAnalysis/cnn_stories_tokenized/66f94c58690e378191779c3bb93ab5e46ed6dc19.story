-LRB- LonelyPlanet.com -RRB- -- Despite the daily foot traffic , Lower Manhattan is one of the most under-appreciated parts of New York City . It 's not just a playground for suits bound for Wall Street bank jobs or tourists following the old New Amsterdam crooked plan through skyscraper canyons heading to the Statue of Liberty -- or , increasingly over the coming months , crowding to get a glimpse of the new 9/11 Memorial .

As someone who has spent most of the last two decades in New York City , I ca n't begin to count the number of times visiting friends and friends of friends have asked me for `` fun things to do in New York City . ''

The hidden sides of Lower Manhattan fit the bill . If you 're heading to visit the 9/11 Memorial and are looking for other things to do in the area , try these tips :

1 . Trinity Church 's gravestones

New York 's most historic church , dating from 1698 , faces Wall Street from Broadway . Visitors often pop in to see the stained glass and perhaps peek into the free museum -LRB- which includes a cut-out $ 10 bill so you can pose as Alexander Hamilton -RRB- .

The Hamilton focus is there because the country 's first US Secretary of Treasury -- who was shot in a duel by the former Vice President Aaron Burr in 1804 -LRB- no , Dick Cheney was n't the first VP to shoot someone -RRB- -- is buried outside . But that 's not the best part of the cemetery . On the bigger plot , on the north side of the church , there are shady spots to sit , and at the far northeastern corner lies James Leeson , who left a coded message atop his tombstone . According to Kevin Walsh 's superb book `` Forgotten New York , '' the code was finally cracked nearly a century after his death in 1794 . The message : `` Remember death . ''

2 . National Museum of the American Indian

Manhattan got its name from the Lenape word for either `` place of hills '' or `` place of inebriation '' -LRB- the latter is certainly more apt in the past few hundred years -RRB- , and Broadway itself follows old hunting trails that date centuries before Henry Hudson wandered this way . A great place to learn more about all of the Americas ' pre-Columbian inhabitants is this free , relatively quiet museum . Part of the Smithsonian -LRB- and open every day -RRB- , the exhibit of artifacts fills the gorgeous century-old Customs House .

Many equate Native Americans with images seen in old westerns -- usually wearing the attire of the Plains Indians , evident in a shirt that may have been worn by Sioux legend Crazy Horse . The `` Infinity of Nations '' exhibit gives a fuller picture . I also enjoyed thumbing through Native American newspapers from around the country and seeing works like a painting by Naiche , a Chiricahua Apache `` prisoner-of-war '' at Fort Sill , Oklahoma a century ago .

3 . Stone Street dining

I 'm always shocked by how many people eat lunch at unmemorable places on Broadway or chains at South Street Seaport . Locals instead bee-line for the city 's first paved street , Stone Street , a small traffic-free winding lane filled with covered tables a few blocks east of Broadway -LRB- and south of Wall Street -RRB- , lined with good food and bars . It gets BUSY on weekday lunches -LRB- noon to 1:30 p.m. -RRB- and as work winds down -LRB- after 4 p.m. -RRB- . Go then , and share an outside table .

I like Adrienne 's Pizza Bar -LRB- 54 Stone St. -RRB- the best , but it comes in one big size -- do n't go solo .

4 . Rat Alley

OK , most people wo n't want to walk down Edens Alley , an L-shaped alley near the corner of Gold Street and Fulton Street , en route from the World Trade Center site to South Street Seaport . But it 's legendary . In 2001 , Robert Sullivan spent many nights here for four seasons , watching a terrifying scene of `` relay teams '' of eight to 10 rats storming into garbage bags that roared like `` a bar brawl in a pup tent . '' Sullivan 's book , `` Rats , '' is creepily fascinating , giving more info than you may want to know about New York 's most famous `` wildlife . ''

You wo n't see rats during the day .

-LRB- By the way , Fulton Street is a common path for visitors to take -- and its scene of chains and discount shops is very simply the least interesting walking street in all of Lower Manhattan . -RRB-

5 . African Burial Ground National Monument

One of New York 's newest museums -- the fascinating African Burial Ground National Monument site built in a new Federal Building in 2010 -- sees , on a good day , about 250 people . Go . You may be alone , and you might not see New York the same way afterward .

During most of the 18th century , as many as 15,000 Africans -- mostly slaves -- were buried in this 6.6-acre corner of the city , and the small museum makes a big impact with the corner of the Federal Hall it occupies . Watch the 20-minute film -LRB- `` this is African Americans ' Ellis Island , '' one person says in it -RRB- and walk past some of the over 400 graves found while building this controversial building in the '90s . This is the population who really built the city , including a giant wooden barrier wall to protect New Amsterdam from the British attack -- the namesake for Wall Street .

Around the corner , just east along Duane Street , there 's a small plot saved from the building plans with a monument to those buried here -- along with visible mounds of crypts underground .
