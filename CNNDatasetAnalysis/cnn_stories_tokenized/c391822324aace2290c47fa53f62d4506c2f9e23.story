`` I do n't think you should have sex with anyone unless you love them , '' Bieber says .

Rolling Stone : Justin Bieber 's world

Other highlights from the story :

The Canadian-born Bieber never plans on becoming an American citizen .

`` You guys are evil , '' he says with a laugh . `` Canada 's the best country in the world . We go to the doctor and we do n't need to worry about paying him , but here , your whole life , you 're broke because of medical bills . My bodyguard 's baby was premature , and now he has to pay for it . In Canada , if your baby 's premature , he stays in the hospital as long as he needs to , and then you go home . ''

He is n't sure what political party he 'd support if he was old enough to vote .

`` I 'm not sure about the parties , '' Bieber says . `` But whatever they have in Korea , that 's bad . '' He does have a solid opinion on abortion .

`` I really do n't believe in abortion , '' Bieber says . `` It 's like killing a baby ? '' How about in cases of rape ?

`` Um . Well , I think that 's really sad , but everything happens for a reason . I guess I have n't been in that position , so I would n't be able to judge that . ''

Bieber 's voice began to change on his last tour .

He 's now working with a vocal coach , which involves doing 20 push-ups before before a session to warm up his chest .

`` He 's got a nice tone to his voice now , '' says his vocal coach Jan Smith . `` It 's a good texture , but it does n't sound like what his fans think he sounds like . He 'll get four octaves eventually . He 's still young . ''

Due to an editing error , this online news item originally included an incomplete quote from our Justin Bieber cover story . The full quote , which appears in full in our March 3 issue reads : `` Um . Well , I think that 's really sad , but everything happens for a reason . I do n't know how that would be a reason . I guess I have n't been in that position , so I would n't be able to judge that . ''
