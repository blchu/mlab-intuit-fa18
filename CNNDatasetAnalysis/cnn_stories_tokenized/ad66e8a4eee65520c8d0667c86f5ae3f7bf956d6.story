-LRB- CNN -RRB- -- It 's a familiar refrain among jet-lagged travelers , usually accompanied by a despondent shrug .

`` Well , I guess we could just grab a quick bite at the hotel . ''

Hotel restaurants have long had a reputation for offering over-priced , unremarkable meals , frequented only by guests too tired or unadventurous to brave the streets of a new city in search of anything better .

But over the last few years , a wave of incredible new restaurants has come onto the scene to change the way we view hotel dining .

For proof , look no further than American food and drink website The Daily Meal 's third annual list of the 101 Best Hotel Restaurants Around the World .

`` In recent years , hotel restaurants have stepped up their game so much so that they have become coveted dining spots for locals and travelers alike , who are often either waiting in line or booking reservations months in advance just to be able to pull up a chair at the hottest restaurant in town -- which happens to be in a hotel , '' says the site .

To curate the list , The Daily Meal staff considered winners and nominees from the 2013 list of best hotel restaurants , consulted the Michelin Guide and other sources for further recommendations and drew hotel restaurants from its annual lists of the 101 Best Restaurants in Asia , Europe , Latin America and the Caribbean .

Then they grouped the selections by continent and invited a panel of experienced bloggers , restaurant critics and other food and lifestyle writers from around the world to vote for their favorites in an online survey .

According to the rules , the hotel has to have at least 15 rooms and restaurants must be under the same roof as the hotel as well as the same proprietorship .

Below are the top 20 to make The Daily Meal 's list .
