The company that bought it from ABC may hold off premiering it for at least a few months and focus on getting `` One Life to Live '' back to fans , instead , according to Variety .

Prospect Park , a media and production company founded in 2009 by Jeffrey Kwatinetz and former Disney Studios head Rich Frank , bought `` AMC '' and `` OLTL '' last July after ABC canceled them . -LRB- `` AMC '' ended in September ; `` OLTL '' goes away in January -RRB- .

The hope was to bow new installments of `` AMC '' online starting in January , but that was before Prospect started having a tough time securing stars from the longtime serial -LRB- here 's looking at you , Susan Lucci ! -RRB- .

So far , only Cameron Mathison -LRB- Ryan Lavery -RRB- and Lindsay Hartley -LRB- Dr. Cara Castillo Martin -RRB- have agreed to continue with `` AMC '' once it goes online .
