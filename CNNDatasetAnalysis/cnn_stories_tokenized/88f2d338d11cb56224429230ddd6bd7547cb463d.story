The usual suspects were there , with `` Avatar '' -LRB- 21 million downloads -RRB- taking top -LRB- dis ? -RRB- honors , and `` The Dark Knight '' tying for second place with `` Transformers '' at 19 million downloads apiece . And , yes , of course there 's a `` Pirates of the Caribbean '' installment on there . It 's only right .

Still , there is surprisingly little overlap between the lists -LRB- only `` Inception '' and `` The Departed '' -RRB- . Apparently Netflix users favor Oscar bait while Internet thieves go for tentpole popcorn movies , with the Venn Diagram overlap between those two strangely being Leonardo DiCaprio . So what other movies made the list , and which were the most head scratch-inducing ? See the full list after the jump .
