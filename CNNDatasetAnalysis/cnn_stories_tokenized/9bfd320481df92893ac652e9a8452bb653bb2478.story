LOS ANGELES , California -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Keri Russell , who stars in the new Adam Sandler comedy `` Bedtime Stories , '' says her own son is a little too young to enjoy a story before bedtime .

Keri Russell , here with `` Bedtime Stories '' co-star Adam Sandler , has a young son .

`` He 's too squiggly and little for that right now . He 's a year and a half , '' Russell tells CNN .

She and husband Shane Deary have tried reading to their tot .

`` We do read -LSB- him -RSB- books , and he has his favorites , but right now it 's very much like ` Read this one , read this one . ' And we read the first two pages , then he 's like , ` and now this one . ' I 'm like ` But we have n't gotten to the best part ! Let me finish . ' It 's a lot of that . ''

Russell and Deary named their son River , which she acknowledges is unusual .

`` It was a name we like , and my husband grew up on Martha 's Vineyard . It was a lot of sort of unusual hippie names , so we thought we could get away with it . ''

Other unconventional celebrity baby names include Bronx Mowgli Wentz -LRB- son of Pete Wentz and Ashlee Simpson -RRB- , Apple Martin -LRB- daughter of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin -RRB- and Naviyd Ely Raymond -LRB- son of singer Usher and Tameka Raymond -RRB- .

Russell offers a reason why some entertainers choose distinctive names for their children : It 's the nature of their work .

`` It 's an unusual life . I mean , so there tend to be creative people , and maybe people are more creative with their names , too , '' she says . `` Or -LSB- they -RSB- feel like they do n't have to be so confined to tradition because it 's such an untraditional line of work . ''
