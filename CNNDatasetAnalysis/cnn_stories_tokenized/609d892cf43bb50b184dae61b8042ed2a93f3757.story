Spanish champions Real Madrid remain the richest football club in the world .

English and European champions Manchester United and Spanish league leaders Barcelona remain in second and third places respectively in the latest `` Football Money League '' report on the world 's 20 biggest clubs ranked by revenue .

Despite their lofty position in the list , United , along with the rest of the English Premier League clubs have been affected by sterling 's recent fall in the money markets .

`` If the exchange rate value of the pound had not depreciated , there would have been nine , rather than seven English clubs in the top 20 and Manchester United would have topped the Money League ahead of Real Madrid , '' Dan Jones , partner in the Sports business group at Deloitte , told Reuters.com .

The impact of the current economic downturn on club revenues was not measured in the report from the 2007-2008 football season .

Fenerbahce became the first Turkish club to feature in the list , while German champions Bayern Munich climbed three places to fourth , reaching the top five for the first time in five years .
