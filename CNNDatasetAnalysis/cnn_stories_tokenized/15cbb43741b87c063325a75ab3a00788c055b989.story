Royal Baby : What 's next ?

George

`` George '' -- the front-runner before the announcement , according to many UK bookmakers -- was the name of Queen Elizabeth 's father , King George VI , who reigned from 1936 until his death in 1952 . He assumed the throne on the abdication of his brother , Edward VIII . His life was depicted in the Oscar-winning movie `` The King 's Speech . ''

George I , born in Germany , became king in 1714 . He was followed by a line of kings with the same name , including George III , who was known for his bouts of insanity .

The name is also a patriotic choice for many in the UK : Saint George , patron saint of England , is known for his legendary defeat of a dragon in the third century . His feast day is celebrated on April 23 , -LRB- the date also associated with the birth of William Shakespeare , England 's most revered writer -RRB- .

Despite its royal connections , George has humble origins , derived as it is from the Greek name `` georgios '' meaning `` earth worker '' or `` farmer . ''

Other historical Georges : composer George Frideric Handel -LRB- 1685-1759 -RRB- , first president of the United States George Washington -LRB- 1732-1799 -RRB- , and the Pacific explorer George Vancouver -LRB- 1757-1798 -RRB- . Authors Mary Anne Evans and Eric Arthur Blair also chose George as their pen names : George Eliot -LRB- 1819-1880 -RRB- and George Orwell -LRB- 1903-1950 -RRB- respectively .

Alexander

This gallant title means `` defender of men , '' from the Latin form of the Greek name `` Alexandros . '' Alexander III of Macedon -LRB- 356-323 B.C. -RRB- , better known as Alexander the Great , courageously ruled and conquered many parts of the world before his untimely death at age 32 .

The name `` Alexander '' is a feature of the Dutch royal family : Willem-Alexander ascended to the throne after the abdication of his mother Queen Beatrix earlier this year .

Other historical Alexanders : English poet Alexander Pope -LRB- 1688-1744 -RRB- , American statesman Alexander Hamilton -LRB- 1755-1804 -RRB- , Scottish-Canadian explorer Alexander MacKenzie -LRB- 1764-1820 -RRB- , Russian poet Alexander Pushkin -LRB- 1799-1837 -RRB- and Alexander Graham Bell -LRB- 1847-1922 -RRB- , the Scottish-born inventor of the telephone .

Louis

The name `` Louis '' originates from the English and French interpretations of the German name Ludwig , which can be interpreted as `` renowned warrior . ''

Louis was the first name of Lord Mountbatten , uncle of George 's great-grandfather Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , and mentor to Prince Charles . He was killed by the IRA while holidaying in Ireland in 1979 .

No British monarch has been named Louis , but it is very popular across the English Channel in France , where 18 kings have taken the name from 814 onward . Louis XIV , the Sun King , reigned from 1643 until 1715 and was hailed by many as the greatest monarch of his age because of the growth in French power and the opulence of his court , which included the Palace of Versailles .

Louis XVI was the king of France from 1774 until 1792 , when he was found guilty of treason after the revolution and executed in 1793 .

Other historical figures named Louis : French scientist Louis Pasteur -LRB- 1822-1895 -RRB- ; MÃ©tis leader Louis Riel -LRB- 1844-1885 -RRB- , who led a rebellion against Canada ; and Scottish author Robert Louis Stevenson -LRB- 1850-1894 -RRB- , who wrote `` Treasure Island '' and `` Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde .
