-LRB- Sunset -RRB- -- Hawaii may seem a world away , but there are plenty of big waves , tiny bubbles and tiki-style spots closer to home . Here are some San Diego-based ways to catch the Hawaiian spirit .

Paradise Point Resort and Spa is a waterfront oasis with a Balinese-style spa and five swimming pools .

Make your own lei

If a luau is on your tropical to-do list , the Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa offers a demo and the materials to design a floral garland for the event . A needle and thread , a pile of seasonal flowers such as plumerias , orchids , mini carnations and tuberose , and the rest is up to you . The resort 's resident tropical macaw and cockatoo birds might make an appearance while you 're at work . Leis stay fragrant and can last more than a week if you refrigerate them and mist with water periodically .

A sunset luau

It 's TGIF , Hawaiian-style . The Catamaran Resort Hotel and Spa throws a Friday-night luau on the lawn by Mission Bay -- and that means hula dancers in grass skirts , fire knife dancing , pi√±a coladas , tiki torches , a ceremonial roast pig on parade and Polynesian drumbeats from a live band . Dances and costumes come from different parts of Polynesia -LRB- Tahiti , Samoa and even New Zealand , as well as Hawaii -RRB- . It 's faux Hawaii , of course , but the festivities are enough to spark your island imagination .

An ocean adventure

Bright orange Garibaldi fish , leopard sharks , giant sea turtles , sea lions and seven sea caves to explore -- it 's not Kauai , it 's La Jolla Shores . The caves are just a half-mile from shore via kayak , and OEX Dive & Kayak Center offers two-hour tours that include guided trips inside the Clam -- one of just two caves you can enter -LRB- at high tide , you can go all the way through -RRB- .

August is a prime month to be out on the water with the warm temps and calm swells . About those silhouettes gliding underneath the boats : Hundreds -LRB- sometimes even thousands -RRB- of leopard sharks swim below the kayaks , and they 're most abundant in summer . Thankfully , leopard sharks have small teeth -LRB- they use suction to eat -RRB- . For the daring , snorkeling is another option . Sunset.com : Take the teens to Kauai

Tiki-style

Mister Tiki Mai Tai Lounge -- the name alone promises tropical cocktails and Polynesian kitsch . The giant tiki masks on the walls , tableside lava lamps and handblown glass blowfish on the ceilings add to the tropical flavor of this spot in downtown 's Gaslamp Quarter . The drinks are pure tiki -- try the lilikoi mojitos with white rum , passion fruit , fresh mint and lime , or a coconut kiss martini with coconut rum , pineapple and coconut cream -LRB- with an orchid floating on top -RRB- . The happy hour -LRB- 5-7 p.m. ; $ 5 -RRB- includes sushi rolls and pupus -LRB- Hawaiian appetizers -RRB- like shiitake-goat cheese wontons .

Hang 10

Surfing is n't just the sport of beach bums . These days anyone can ride a wave , and La Jolla Shores Beach is great for beginners , with its sandy-bottom shoreline and small waves . Surf Diva , a surf school started by twin-sister surfers in 1996 , gives private or group surf lessons -LRB- wetsuit and board included -RRB- . Lessons start on the sand , where you 'll learn how to paddle , pop up and master the surf stance before you hit the water . Sunset.com : Blue Hawaii
